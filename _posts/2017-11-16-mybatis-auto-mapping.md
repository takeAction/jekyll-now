### Auto mapping

As the name implies, when do auto mapping, mybatis will get the column name and look for a property with the same name ignoring case.
That means that if a column name ID and property name id are found, mybatis will set the id property with the ID column value.

In simple case, mybatis can auto-map the results for you and in other cases(e.g. nested collection/association) 
you need to build a result map by youself, or mix both strategies.

For instance, 

```xml
<resultMap id="rm" type="student">

</resultMap>
<select id="" resultMap="rm">
    SELECT
        ID,
        NAME
    FROM
        STUDENT
</select>
```
In this case, we can leave <resultMap> empty, just have the definition, then mybatis can auto map the result to java bean student.

However, for 

```xml
    <resultMap id="rm" type="teacher">
        <id ...>
        <result ...>
        <collection property="students" ofType="student">
            <id ...>
            <result ...>
        </collection>
    </resultMap>
    <select id="" resultMap="rm">
        ....
    </select>
```
we have to define the mapping manually by default.

Mix strategy : all columns that are present in the ResultSet that have not a manual mapping will be auto-mapped, 
then manual mappings will be processed. 
In the following sample id and userName columns will be auto-mapped and hashed_password column will be mapped

```xml
<select id="selectUsers" resultMap="userResultMap">
  select
    user_id             as "id",
    user_name           as "userName",
    hashed_password
  from some_table
  where id = #{id}
</select>
<resultMap id="userResultMap" type="User">
  <result property="password" column="hashed_password"/>
</resultMap>
```

### Mapping level

There are three auto mapping levels:
- NONE, disable auto mapping, only manually mapped properties will be set
- PARTIAL, auto map results except those that have nested result mappings defined inside(join)
- FULL, auto maps everything

#### Mapping level config

Developer can set this level in mybatis config via `autoMappingBehavior` like:

```xml
<settings>
 
  <setting name="autoMappingBehavior" value="PARTIAL"/>
  <setting name="autoMappingUnknownColumnBehavior" value="WARNING"/> 
  <setting name="mapUnderscoreToCamelCase" value="false"/> 
</settings>
```
the default level is partial.

`mapUnderscoreToCamelCase` enables automatic mapping from database column like `BOOKING_ID` to java bean property like `bookingId`,
default is false

And `autoMappingUnknownColumnBehavior` is used to specify the behavior when detects an unknown column or unknown property type
of automatic mapping target.  It has three values:
- NONE, do nothing
- WARNING, output warning log(The log level of 'org.apache.ibatis.session.AutoMappingUnknownColumnBehavior' must be set to WARN)
- FAILING, Fail mapping (Throw SqlSessionException)

its default value is none.

--Note, full is used at risk--, take following to illustrate the risk:

```xml
<select id="selectBlog" resultMap="blogResult">
  select
    B.id,
    B.title,
    A.username,
  from Blog B left outer join Author A on B.author_id = A.id
  where B.id = #{id}
</select>
<resultMap id="blogResult" type="Blog">
  <association property="author" resultMap="authorResult"/>
</resultMap>

<resultMap id="authorResult" type="Author">
  <result property="username" column="author_username"/>
</resultMap>
```
With this result map and if level is full, then both Blog and Author will be auto-mapped, but Author has id property and
there is a column named id in the result set, so Author's id will be filled with Blog's id, and that is not what we expect.

##### autoMapping attribute

If `autoMapping` attribute present in `<resultMap >`, mybatis will enable or disable the automapping for this result map.
This attibute overrides the global `autoMappingBehavior`, it is unset by default.

For nested result map, this attribute has no effect on an external resultMap.
