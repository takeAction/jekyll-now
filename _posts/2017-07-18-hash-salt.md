1. hash salt
    
    e.g. hash("hello") will generate hash value '2cf24dba5', two same plain text have same hash values.
    
    In order to create different hash values despite same original string as well as making hacker harder to steal password,
    we can randomize the hash by appending or prepending a random string, call a **salt**, to the password before hashing,
    for example, hash("hello"+"abc123"), here abc123 is the salt.
    
    In practice, the salt is stored in DB as a separate column or as part of the hash string itself.
    
    The salt does not need to be secret.

2. hash collision
    
    It means two different source string have same hash value.

3. number of hash iteration
    
    For instance, if hash iteration is 2, then it represents hash(hash("hello")), that is has twice.
