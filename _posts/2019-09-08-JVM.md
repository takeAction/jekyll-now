### JVM Memory Model

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jvm.png)

#### Young Generation

1. It contains newly-allocated objects
2. Most of the newly-created objects goes to `Eden`.
3. When Eden space is full, `Minor GC` is performed and 
   all the survivor objects are moved to one of the survivor spaces.
4. `Minor GC` also checks the survivor objects and move them to the other survivor space. 
   So at a time, one of the survivor space is always empty.

#### Old Generation

1. Objects that are survived after many cycles of minor gc are moved to the Old generation
2. When Old Gen space is full, `major gc` is performed.

#### Why Heap divided into Generations

In General Applications most of the objects are short-lived. Fewer and fewer objects remain allocated over time.

That’s why to enhance the performance of the JVM, Heap is broken up into smaller parts called generations and JVM performs GC in these generations when the memory is about to fill up.

#### PermGen

Since `PermGen` is removed from `jdk8`, thus the `PermSize` and `MaxPermSize` JVM arguments are ignored and 
a warning is issued if they present at start-up.

#### Metaspace

The class definitions are loaded into Metaspace.

By default `metaspace` is limited by the amount of available native memory.

A new flag `MaxMetaspaceSize` allowing you to limit the amount of native memory used for class metadata. 

If you don’t specify this flag, the `Metaspace` will dynamically re-size depending of the application demand at runtime.

### Garbage Collection

As long as an object is being referenced, the JVM considers it alive. 

Once an object is no longer referenced and therefore is not reachable by the application code, the garbage collector removes it and reclaims the unused memory. 

#### When

when JVM runs Garbage Collector, we can not expect.

#### Garbage Collector

1. Serial
2. Parallel
3. CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep)
4. G1 (Garbage First)

#### Minor GC

Minor gc is triggered if `Eden` is full.

Since Young generation keeps short-lived objects, Minor GC is very fast and the application doesn’t get affected by this.

#### Major GC

Major GC takes a long time because it checks all the live objects. 

Major GC should be minimized because it will make your application unresponsive for the garbage collection duration. 

The duration taken by garbage collector depends on the strategy used for garbage collection.

#### Full GC

Full GC is cleaning the entire Heap – both Young and Old generation.

#### Monitor

We can use the Java command line as well as UI tools for monitoring garbage collection activities of an application. 

##### jstat

JDK built-in tool.

##### jvisualvm

JDK built-in tool.

Just run `jvisualvm` command in the terminal to launch the Java VisualVM application. 

Once launched, you need to install `Visual GC` plugin from Tools --> Plugins option
