Using following tables to illustrate sql join clause.

table class :

table student :

<a href="https://2freesky.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/student.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42" src="https://2freesky.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/student.png" alt="student" width="131" height="187" /></a>

<strong>1.left join</strong>

select * from class c left join student s on c.id=s.id;

The result is :

<a href="https://2freesky.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/r1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43" src="https://2freesky.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/r1.png" alt="r1" width="264" height="159" /></a>

It returns rows according to table class even table student has not the associated row.

<strong> 2. right join</strong>

select * from class c right join student s on c.id=s.id;

Right join similar left join except it base on student, thus the result has 7 records.

<strong>3. inner join</strong>

select * from class c inner join student s on c.id=s.id;

Following is the returned rows :

<a href="https://2freesky.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/r2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44" src="https://2freesky.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/r2.png" alt="r2" width="260" height="130" /></a>

It only return the records which c.id=s.id.

<strong>4. cross join</strong>

select * from class cross join student;

This results in Cartesian Product, that is if table class has x rows and table student has y rows, then this sql return x*y rows.  Here is 6*7=42 rows.

This sql is the same as : select * from class, student;

In the same way, select * from class c, student s where c.owner is null and s.name is null is the Cartesian Product  of the number of c.owner is null and the number of s.name is null.
