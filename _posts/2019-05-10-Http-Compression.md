### Enable compression in tomcat

Modify the `server.xml`, add `compression` and `compressionMinSize` to `Connector`, that's it.

```xml
  <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               compression="on"
               compressionMinSize="1024"
               redirectPort="8443" />
```

Before compression, the request/response looks like:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/http-compression-1.png)

The size of response is `243.3 KB(transferred size)` and the time is `466ms`.

After compression, it changed to:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/http-compression-2.png)

Now the transferred size is `25.78 KB` and the time is `218ms`.

Meanwhile the response header has attributes `Content-Encoding:gzip` and `vary:accept-encoding`.

### Enable compression in spring boot with embeded tomcat

While if we use spring boot in `embeded tomcat`, we need to add configuration to `application.yml`:

```yml
server:
  port: 8080
  servlet:
    context-path: /jwt
  compression:
    enabled: true
    mime-types: text/html,text/xml,text/plain,text/css,text/javascript,application/javascript,application/json
    # Compress the response only if the response size is at least 1KB
    min-response-size: 1024 
```
