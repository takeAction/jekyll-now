There are different relationships between objects.

## IS-A 

  `extends` or `implements` means **IS-A** relationship.
  
  For example, `Apple extends Fruit` means apple is a fruit, but fruit is not apple.

## HAS-A

  **HAS-A** relationship contains **Assocation**, **Aggregation** and **Composition**.

  This relationship stands for one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many.

## Dependency

  A dependency relationship indicates that changes to one object can cause changes in another object.
