One of the most popular forms of cloud computing is `software-as-a-service`, `SaaS`(`/sæs/`) for short. 

It is is software licensing and delivery model in which a service provider hosts applications for customers and 
makes them available via the internet. That is app software, and app data etc are located in the service provider’s data center. 

One common example is email.

SaaS is one of the three major categories of cloud services, along with `IaaS`(infrastructure-as-a-service) and 
`PaaS`(platform-as-a-service).

2. Lose some level of control which is one of the trade-offs of cloud computing in general
3. New version. Maybe not want adopt the cost of new version.
4. Migrate to a new SaaS provider is not easy
