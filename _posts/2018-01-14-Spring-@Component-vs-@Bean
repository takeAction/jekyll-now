1. `@Component` is class level, while `@Bean` is method level

2. Generally, the methods annotated with `@Bean` are declared within `@Configuration` class

```
public class Car { 
  .....
}

@Configuration
public class AppConfig { 
  @Bean
  public Car getCar() { 
    return new Car(); 
  } 
} 

@Autowired
private Car car; 
```

3. `@Bean` decouples the declaration of the bean from the class definition

4. `@Component` class will be registered as a bean by auto scan component
