JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.  It is a lightweight text-based interchange format which is language indepent.

It looks like next : 

```
{
   "book": [
      {
         "id":1,
         "language": null,
         "edition": true,
         "author": {"name":"abc"}
      },
      {
         "id":7,
         "language": "C++", 
         "edition": false,
         "author": {"name":"def"}
      }
   ]
}
```

JSON is key-value pair, key has to be string, while value has following types:

|type|remark|
|----|------|
|Number|double precision floating point|
|String|     |
|Boolean|true or false|
|Array|it begins with [ and ends with ]|
|Object|it begins with { and ends with }|
|null|    |

In JavaScript, we can create json object like 

```
var books = {
              "Pascal" : [ 
                { "Name"  : "Pascal Made Simple", "price" : 700 },
                { "Name"  : "Guide to Pascal", "price" : 400 }
              ],  
              "Scala"  : [
                { "Name"  : "Scala for the Impatient", "price" : 1000 }, 
                { "Name"  : "Scala in Depth", "price" : 1300 }
              ]    
            } 
         
for(i = 0;i<books.Pascal.length;i++){
      books.Pascal[i].Name+"</td></tr>");
           
}
```

And there are JSON.parse()/JSON.stringify() to convert json from/to js object.

In java, there are some 3rd library to do convertion, e.g. Gson, Jackson.

For Gson, its code as follows

```
Gson gson = new Gson();
JsonObject json = gson.fromJson(gson.toJson(c), JsonObject.class);
System.out.println(json.get("name").getAsString());
```
